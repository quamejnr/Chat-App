## What is this?
This is a simple chat application between a server and a client.

## Why this?
I've been learning about Computer Networking while getting familiar with the C language. 
This project was an opportunity to learn about socket programming while getting acquainted with the C language.

## How to run this?
1. Compile the client.c file by running `gcc -o client client.c` in the root folder.
2. Compile the server.c file by running `gcc -o server server.c` in the root folder.
3. Run the server on any port of your chosen eg. `./server 8080`.
4. Then run the client on the same port as the server eg. `./client 8080`.
5. You can type something like `Hello World` on the client side and hit enter and your chat begins.

## What I learnt?
1. Basics of C.
2. Basics of socket programming.
3. TCP multiplexing and demultiplexing
